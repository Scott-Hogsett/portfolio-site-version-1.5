            <h1>Infographic Project</h1>
            <h2>Infographic of the continents</h2>    
            <p>This project we had to create a infographic based on population, but it could be any subject that we wanted. I started of with researching other infographics both online and also at the library with books such as Information is Beautiful and Data Flow. The subject I ended up going with was the opulation of the continents and how they compare to each other.</p>

            <h2>Colour palette and font</h2>    
            <p>Starting this project I wanted to do a different approach and choose the font at the start while doing the research for the topic, I wanted to choose a positive colour palette and font and then build the design upon that so that the project had a direction.</p>

            <h2>logo</h2>    
            <p>I think that the logo is interesting as well as expressing that it is a information based project, I created it by turning the typeface into a shape so I could then manipulate the achor points so that the 'Infographic' and 'continents' would be prominent and the 'of the' would fit in nicely.</p>

            <h2>Illustration Sketches</h2>    
            <p>From the research I did on infographics I knew that the illustrations that represent the information are really important, the user has to be able to look at the illustration and know exactly what the information is.  </p>

            <h2>Illustrations</h2>    
            <p>I worked hard on creating a file of illustration assets that would work for the project. I created all of them on illustrator and tried to maintain a level of consistency throughout and try to stick to the colour palette but I did use others when the illustration had more detail.</p>

            <p>This is a layout plan that I had but didn't end up using because the amount of information that there was to present, this layout just wasn't realistic and I would have given myself a headache trying to squeeze it all in.</p>

            <h2>Layout sketches</h2>    
            <p>In every infographic the layout is crucial to get right, this is because the amount of information that there is you want to make it as smooth and easy for the user to take the information in. Users often like to read infographics quicker rather than slower so the layout has to keep this in mind.</p>

            <p>The fourth section went under a few different versions to try and get the table the way I wanted it to be, this was both to save space but also be clear and easy for the reader to read. The final version of the table is the best because I think the information is clear to see and it also looks good. </p>
