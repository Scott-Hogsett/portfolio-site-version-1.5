            <h2>Monogram</h2>    
            <p>We were tasked with developing a brand which would represent us and and show potential clients what we were about and get a sense of our character. We had to develop a monogram, wordmark and a visualmarque.</p>

            <h2>Sketches</h2>    
            <p>Sketching the monogram was quite time consuming becuase there was so many variations of the S and H, but it was important to find the one that was for me.<br><br>Although a large amount of the sketches did get disgarded my lecturer did ear mark a few that I could develop.</p>

            <p>I then digitised the sketches he marked out to see what they would look like on screen but I didn’t feel like they were that strong and they didn’t really represent me so I went back to sketching.</p>

            <h2>Monogram sketches</h2>    
            <p>At this point I was starting to have a bit more direction and a design that I liked, but I needed to keep sketching out to nail down the smaller details.<br><br>The main challenge was making sure that the design actually looked like and S and a H and finding the balance of it making sense and still being aesthetically pleasing.</p>

            <h2>Getting it right</h2>    
            <p>The sketching process was done and I then needed to digitise the sketches, here I would be able to measure the thickness of the lines a bit better and see what it would look like on screen.<br><br>These are the first digitised sketches, but this was just so I could workout the thicknesses of the lines because I felt that the sketchbook wasn’t as acurate as doing it in illustrator.</p>

            <h2>Finished monogram</h2>    
            <p>This is the finished monogram, the thickness of the lines was important to give the monogram balance, so I used lines to judge the thickness as you can see on the left.<br><br>Overall I am happy with the design of the monogram, I like the balance and I think that it represents me and the brand that I am going for.</p>

            <h2>Typography</h2>    
            <p>I found this font on Googlefonts and I really liked it, I think that it looks professional but it also has a bit of character and doesn’t look serious which I think is perfect for a portfolio.</p>

            <h2>Colour palette</h2>    
            <p>When using the colour palette I wanted to keep it simple in order to let the portfolio content stand out.<br><br>I liked the green colour and I explored different shades and variations of it on Adobe colour and I found the colour that I really like.</p>

            <h2>Wordmark</h2>    
            <p>For the wordmark I had two variations, one was the word mark when on it’s own and the other was the workmark paired with the monogram, I felt it was important to have both incase circumstances called for either one.<br><br>When designing it I just typed my name out and and used the create outlines and then tightened it up a bit but left a bigger gap in between the first and second name and used the lines similarly to the monogram itself.</p>

            <p>Another piece of branding that I created was the visualmarque which I really liked because there was no rules really set and I could be creative and create something that represented me.<br><br>One of the recurring features when I researched visualmarques is that they pick something that is unique or a feature of themselves so I thought that I could use my glasses.</p>
